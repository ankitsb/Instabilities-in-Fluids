This comes under the name **generalized stability theory** and it often describes a situation like the scenario 4. above. Perturbations can grow (but not at an exponential rate). However, they can ofter grow *a lot*! This situation usual in problems in fluid dynamics and the reason for that is that often the linear operators that govern the perturbation dynamics in fluids problems are *non-normal*. (More details on non-normality will come in a following lecture.)"

Clearly though scenario (c) is very different from scenario (b) above. This suggest that yet another notion of perturbation growth in needed; something that deals with perturbation growth over **finite time-intervals**. We will introduce this notion later on when we talk about transient perturbation growth in non-normal dynamical systems. For now we focus on asymptotic stability."
